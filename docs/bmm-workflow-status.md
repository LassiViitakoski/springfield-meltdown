## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

*Epic SPRING-001 broken down into 11 stories across 3 sprints*

**Epic:** SPRING-001 - Combat Prototype Foundation (21 story points)

**Story Queue:**
- **BACKLOG:** 10 stories (19 points remaining)
  - Sprint 1: Stories 1.2-1.4 (6 points) - Player & Movement
  - Sprint 2: Stories 2.1-2.4 (8 points) - Combat Mechanics
  - Sprint 3: Stories 3.1-3.3 (5 points) - Health & Victory
- **TODO:** SPRING-001-1.2 (Player Entity & Sprite Rendering)
- **IN PROGRESS:** SPRING-001-1.1 (Project Setup & Window Rendering) - Status: Ready
- **DONE:** 0 stories (0 points)

---

## What to Do Next

**Next Action:** Generate Context for Story SPRING-001-1.1, then Implement

**Command to run:** `*story-context` (recommended) or `*dev-story` (skip context)

**Agent to load:** `/bmad:bmm:agents:sm` (for story-context) OR `/bmad:bmm:agents:dev` (for dev-story)

**Why this next?**
- Story SPRING-001-1.1 is now marked Ready for development
- Context generation recommended: assembles relevant docs/code for DEV agent
- Implementation: Project Setup & Window Rendering (2 points, 2-4 hours)
- Tech spec available: tech-spec-epic-SPRING-001.md

## Notes

- **Project Level 2** means you have multiple features/epics
- **Phase 3 required** for this project due to technical architecture needs (Rust/ggez, coordinate systems, entity management)
- Tech specs generated JIT (Just-In-Time) per epic as needed
- UX considerations embedded in GDD (isometric view, combat feel, UI elements)
- Run `*workflow-status` anytime to check progress and get recommendations
- **Current Epic:** SPRING-001 Combat Prototype Foundation (21 points, 3 sprints, 6-12 weeks)
