## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

*Epic SPRING-001 broken down into 11 stories across 3 sprints*

**Epic:** SPRING-001 - Combat Prototype Foundation (21 story points)

**Story Queue:**
- **BACKLOG:** 6 stories (10 points remaining)
  - Sprint 2: Stories 2.2-2.4 (5 points) - Combat Mechanics
  - Sprint 3: Stories 3.1-3.3 (5 points) - Health & Victory
- **TODO:** SPRING-001-2.1 (Mouse Aiming System) - Ready to start
- **IN PROGRESS:** None (Story 1.4 awaiting git commit)
- **DONE:** 4 stories (9 points) - SPRING-001-1.1, SPRING-001-1.2, SPRING-001-1.3, SPRING-001-1.4

---

## What to Do Next

**Next Action:** Generate Story Context for SPRING-001-1.4

**Command to run:** `*story-context` (with SM agent)

**Agent to load:** `/bmad:bmm:agents:sm`

**Why this next?**
- Story SPRING-001-1.3 completed (3 points earned)
- Story SPRING-001-1.4 moved to IN PROGRESS
- Need to generate context XML before implementation
- Implementation: Camera & Debug UI (2 points, 2-4 hours)
- Tech spec available: tech-specs/tech-spec-epic-SPRING-001.md

- **2025-10-19:** Architecture documentation session with Game Architect (Cloud Dragonborn):
  - Discussed entity rendering optimization strategy (3-phase evolution: naive → viewport culling → spatial partitioning)
  - Created architecture/system-architecture.md: Cross-cutting technical strategy document covering entity management, coordinate systems, collision detection, performance budgets, module organization

## Notes

- **Project Level 2** means you have multiple features/epics
- **Phase 3 required** for this project due to technical architecture needs (Rust/ggez, coordinate systems, entity management)
- Tech specs generated JIT (Just-In-Time) per epic as needed
- UX considerations embedded in GDD (isometric view, combat feel, UI elements)
- Run `*workflow-status` anytime to check progress and get recommendations
- **Current Epic:** SPRING-001 Combat Prototype Foundation (21 points, 3 sprints, 6-12 weeks)

**Architecture Guidance:**
- Epic implementations reference `architecture/system-architecture.md` for cross-cutting patterns
- Major technical decisions logged in `architecture/technical-decisions.md` using ADR format
- Entity management, coordinate systems, collision, and performance budgets defined for Epic 1-4+ evolution
