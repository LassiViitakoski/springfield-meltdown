## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

*Epic SPRING-001 broken down into 11 stories across 3 sprints*

**Epic:** SPRING-001 - Combat Prototype Foundation (21 story points)

**Story Queue:**
- **BACKLOG:** 7 stories (12 points remaining)
  - Sprint 2: Stories 2.1-2.4 (8 points) - Combat Mechanics
  - Sprint 3: Stories 3.1-3.3 (5 points) - Health & Victory (minus Story 3.3, 1 point)
- **TODO:** None (ready to pull from backlog)
- **IN PROGRESS:** SPRING-001-1.4 (Camera & Debug UI) - Status: Ready to Start
- **DONE:** 3 stories (7 points) - SPRING-001-1.1, SPRING-001-1.2, SPRING-001-1.3

---

## What to Do Next

**Next Action:** Generate Story Context for SPRING-001-1.4

**Command to run:** `*story-context` (with SM agent)

**Agent to load:** `/bmad:bmm:agents:sm`

**Why this next?**
- Story SPRING-001-1.3 completed (3 points earned)
- Story SPRING-001-1.4 moved to IN PROGRESS
- Need to generate context XML before implementation
- Implementation: Camera & Debug UI (2 points, 2-4 hours)
- Tech spec available: tech-spec-epic-SPRING-001.md

## Notes

- **Project Level 2** means you have multiple features/epics
- **Phase 3 required** for this project due to technical architecture needs (Rust/ggez, coordinate systems, entity management)
- Tech specs generated JIT (Just-In-Time) per epic as needed
- UX considerations embedded in GDD (isometric view, combat feel, UI elements)
- Run `*workflow-status` anytime to check progress and get recommendations
- **Current Epic:** SPRING-001 Combat Prototype Foundation (21 points, 3 sprints, 6-12 weeks)
