## Notes

- **Project Level 2** means you have multiple features/epics
- **Phase 3 required** for this project due to technical architecture needs (Rust/ggez, coordinate systems, entity management)
- Tech specs generated JIT (Just-In-Time) per epic as needed
- UX considerations embedded in GDD (isometric view, combat feel, UI elements)
- Run `*workflow-status` anytime to check progress and get recommendations
- **Current Epic:** SPRING-001 Combat Prototype Foundation (21 points, 3 sprints, 6-12 weeks)
