**Story ID:** SPRING-001-1.3

**Sprint:** Sprint 1
**Story Points:** 3
**Estimated Hours:** 3-5 hours
**Status:** Complete

## User Story

```
AS A player
I WANT to move my character with WASD keys
SO THAT I can navigate the game world
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] WASD keys move player in 8 directions (up, down, left, right, diagonals)
- [x] Movement speed = 300 pixels/second (adjusted for screen-space movement)
- [x] Diagonal movement normalized (same speed as cardinal directions)
- [x] Movement is smooth and responsive
- [x] Player cannot leave screen bounds (collision with edges)

---

## Technical Notes

- Use ggez keyboard input API
- Normalize velocity vector when length > 0
- Apply movement: pos += velocity * speed * delta_time
- Screen bounds check: clamp position to (0, 0) → (800, 600)

### Context Reference
- [story-context-SPRING-001.SPRING-001-1.3.xml](story-context-SPRING-001.SPRING-001-1.3.xml) - Generated 2025-10-18

### Debug Log
**Implementation approach:**
- Added KeyCode import for keyboard input handling
- Implemented WASD input collection in EventHandler::update()
- Applied screen-space movement (not world-space) for better gameplay feel in isometric view
- Normalization prevents diagonal speed boost (sqrt calculation)
- Movement formula: pos += normalized_velocity * speed * delta_time
- Screen bounds calculated for 600x400 debug box with 16px radius padding
- Speed tuned through iteration: 150 → 50 → 20 → 50 → 150 → 300 px/sec (final)
- Debug green box added for bounds visualization during development

**Key decisions:**
- Used screen-space movement instead of world-space isometric inverse transform
  - Reason: Equal perceived speed in all screen directions for action gameplay
  - Trade-off: Player movement not aligned with isometric world grid (acceptable for prototype)
- Final speed 300 px/sec (2x original spec) for responsive feel
- Player position stored in screen coordinates, isometric transform reserved for future use

### Completion Notes
All acceptance criteria validated through manual testing:
- 8-directional movement (W/A/S/D + diagonals) working correctly
- Movement speed 300 px/sec feels responsive and appropriate for gameplay
- Diagonal normalization confirmed (no speed boost)
- Movement smooth and responsive with instant direction changes
- Screen bounds collision working perfectly (player stays fully inside bounds box)

Implementation complete and tested. Ready for review.

### File List

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Lassi Viitakoski
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Outcome:** **Approve** ✓

### Summary

Story SPRING-001-1.3 (8-Directional Player Movement) successfully implements all acceptance criteria. Implementation demonstrates solid understanding of ggez input APIs, vector normalization, and frame-independent movement. Code is clean, well-commented, and appropriate for prototype phase. One intentional deviation from original spec (movement speed 300 vs 150 px/sec) was made based on gameplay feel during development and documented in story notes.

### Key Findings

**Medium Severity**

**[MED-1] Movement Speed Deviation from Tech Spec**
- **Location:** src/main.rs:29
- **Issue:** Player speed set to 300.0 px/sec instead of 150.0 px/sec specified in tech spec AC-1.3 and story context XML
- **Impact:** Gameplay feel differs from original design intent
- **Rationale:** Dev notes indicate iterative tuning (150 → 50 → 20 → 50 → 150 → 300) for "responsive feel"
- **Assessment:** Acceptable for prototype phase; user validated during manual testing. Story AC updated to reflect 300 px/sec.
- **Recommendation:** Update tech-spec-epic-SPRING-001.md AC-1.3 to document final speed value for consistency

**Low Severity**

**[LOW-1] Unused Coordinate Transform Function**
- **Location:** src/main.rs:39-46 (world_to_screen)
- **Issue:** Function defined but never called; movement implemented in screen-space instead of world-space
- **Impact:** Dead code; future stories expecting world-space movement may need refactoring
- **Assessment:** Intentional design decision documented in dev notes. Trade-off accepted for simpler prototype implementation.
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding #[allow(dead_code)] annotation or removing if not needed for Story 1.4

**[LOW-2] Manual Vector Normalization**
- **Location:** src/main.rs:84-88
- **Issue:** Hand-rolled sqrt/division instead of ggez's Vec2 length()/normalize() methods
- **Impact:** Minor: bypasses framework utilities but functionally correct
- **Assessment:** Works correctly; division-by-zero protected (line 85 check)
- **Recommendation:** No action required for prototype; consider using ggez::glam::Vec2 methods in future refactoring

**[LOW-3] Suppressed Dead Code Warnings**
- **Location:** src/main.rs:13 (#[allow(dead_code)])
- **Issue:** Player struct fields (hp, max_hp, last_shot_time) unused in current story
- **Impact:** None; fields required for future stories (SPRING-001-2.2, SPRING-001-3.1)
- **Assessment:** Appropriate suppression per tech spec guidance
- **Recommendation:** None; warnings will resolve when fields used in Sprint 2/3

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC ID | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| AC-1 | WASD 8-directional movement | ✅ PASS | Lines 70-81: Input collection for W/A/S/D keys |
| AC-2 | Movement speed 300 px/sec | ✅ PASS | Line 29: speed = 300.0 (deviation documented) |
| AC-3 | Diagonal normalization | ✅ PASS | Lines 84-88: Normalize if length > 0 |
| AC-4 | Smooth and responsive | ✅ PASS | Line 94: delta time applied, manual testing validated |
| AC-5 | Screen bounds collision | ✅ PASS | Lines 103-109: Clamp with radius padding |

**Coverage:** 5/5 acceptance criteria met (100%)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Manual Testing Completed:**
- ✅ All 8 movement directions tested (cardinal + diagonal)
- ✅ Diagonal speed verified equal to cardinal (no sqrt(2) boost)
- ✅ Screen bounds collision validated (player stays inside green debug box)
- ✅ Movement speed feels responsive (subjective acceptance)

**Testing Gaps:**
- No automated unit tests (acceptable per tech spec Phase 1 strategy)
- Speed measurement not logged/verified programmatically (300 px/sec assumed correct based on formula)
- Edge case not tested: simultaneous opposing keys (W+S, A+D) - likely results in zero velocity (safe)

**Test Quality Assessment:** Manual testing adequate for prototype phase per tech spec. No test automation required for Story 1.3.

### Architectural Alignment

**Module Structure:** ✅ Aligned
- Player struct matches tech spec data model (line 14-22)
- EventHandler::update pattern follows ggez architecture (line 62-112)

**Coordinate System:** ⚠️ Deviation (Accepted)
- **Spec:** World coordinates with isometric screen projection
- **Actual:** Screen-space movement (world_to_screen unused)
- **Impact:** Simpler implementation; player movement not tied to isometric grid
- **Trade-off:** Accepted per dev notes ("Equal perceived speed in all screen directions for action gameplay")
- **Future Risk:** LOW - Story 1.4 (camera) may need adjustment if camera expects world-space

**Design Constraints:** ✅ Met
- No heap allocations in hot path (stack-based Vec2)
- Frame-independent movement (delta time multiplier)
- Rust ownership: mutable borrow in update() (line 62)

### Security Notes

**No security issues identified.** This is an offline single-player game with no external inputs or network communication.

**Safety Review:**
- ✅ No unsafe blocks
- ✅ Division by zero protected (line 85: if length > 0.0)
- ✅ Position clamping prevents overflow (line 108-109)
- ✅ No panics or unwraps in movement logic
- ✅ Rust bounds checking prevents out-of-bounds access
