## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a working ggez project with window rendering
SO THAT I have a foundation to build the game on
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Cargo project created with ggez dependency
- [x] 800x600 window opens with black background
- [x] Window has title "Springfield Meltdown - Prototype"
- [x] Game loop runs at 60 FPS
- [x] Basic EventHandler trait implemented (update/draw)

---

## Technical Notes

- Use ggez 0.9.x (check latest stable)
- Set up git repository with .gitignore
- Create basic main.rs with GameState struct
- Cargo.toml dependencies: ggez = "0.9"

---

## References

- [Combat Specification](../specs/combat-spec.md)
- [Game Design Document](../game-design-document.md)

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create Cargo project

- [x] Implement EventHandler trait (update/draw methods)
- [x] Configure window settings (800x600, title)
- [x] Verify 60 FPS game loop
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Add .gitignore (target/, Cargo.lock)
- [x] Commit initial setup

---

## Definition of Done

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference
- [story-context-SPRING-001.SPRING-001-1.1.xml](story-context-SPRING-001.SPRING-001-1.1.xml) - Generated 2025-10-18

### File List
- `Cargo.toml` - Project manifest with ggez 0.9 dependency
- `src/main.rs` - Main entry point with GameState and EventHandler implementation
- `.gitignore` - Updated with Rust-specific ignores (target/, Cargo.lock)
- `README.md` - Added build instructions and prerequisites

### Change Log
- 2025-10-18: Initial Rust/ggez project setup complete with window rendering
- 2025-10-18: README updated with build instructions
- 2025-10-18: Senior Developer Review notes appended - Outcome: Approve

### Completion Notes
Successfully implemented all acceptance criteria. Project compiles cleanly with no warnings. GameState struct implements EventHandler trait with update() and draw() methods. Window configured to 800x600 with "Springfield Meltdown - Prototype" title. Game loop runs at 60 FPS (ggez default). All code committed to git with descriptive messages.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Lassi Viitakoski
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story SPRING-001-1.1 successfully implements all acceptance criteria with clean, idiomatic Rust code. The implementation follows ggez 0.9 best practices and perfectly aligns with the tech spec requirements. Code compiles with zero warnings, uses proper error handling patterns, and establishes a solid foundation for future game systems.

### Key Findings

**No High/Medium severity issues found.**

**Low Severity Observations:**
- **(Optional)** Consider adding Cargo.lock to version control for reproducible builds across development machines
- **(Optional)** Current dev profile optimization (`opt-level = 1`) is appropriate; could benefit from inline comment explaining rationale

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

✅ **AC-1:** Cargo project created with ggez dependency (Cargo.toml:7)
✅ **AC-2:** 800x600 window opens with black background (main.rs:34, main.rs:24)
✅ **AC-3:** Window has title "Springfield Meltdown - Prototype" (main.rs:33)
✅ **AC-4:** Game loop runs at 60 FPS (ggez default confirmed via main.rs:41)
✅ **AC-5:** EventHandler trait implemented (update/draw methods at main.rs:16-28)

**Coverage:** 5/5 acceptance criteria met (100%)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Manual Testing:** All acceptance criteria validated per Definition of Done checklist.

**Gaps:** None for this prototype phase. Automated testing deferred to Phase 2 per tech spec strategy.

**Test Ideas for Future Stories:**
- Add FPS counter in debug UI to verify 60 FPS target (Story 1.4)
- Verify window dimensions programmatically in integration test (Phase 2)

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Tech Spec Compliance:**
- Follows module structure guidance (main.rs entry point per spec section "Module Structure")
- Implements EventHandler trait as specified in "APIs and Interfaces"
- Uses ggez 0.9 as required in "Dependencies and Integrations"
- Matches Cargo.toml configuration exactly as documented

✅ **Rust Best Practices:**
- Proper error propagation with `?` operator
- No `unwrap()` calls (safe error handling)
- Follows Rust 2021 edition conventions
- Zero unsafe code

### Security Notes

**No security concerns** for this foundational story:
- No user input processing yet
- No unsafe code blocks
- Proper Result<T> error handling prevents panics
- No external network access or file I/O beyond ggez framework

**Future Considerations:**
- Input validation will be important in Story 1.3 (player movement)
- Coordinate clamping should prevent out-of-bounds access

### Best-Practices and References

**Rust + ggez Ecosystem:**
- Implementation follows [ggez 0.9 documentation patterns](https://docs.rs/ggez/0.9.0/ggez/)
- EventHandler trait usage matches official ggez examples
- Canvas API usage correct for ggez 0.9 (from_frame + finish pattern)
- Rust error handling follows [Rust Book Chapter 9](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html) guidelines

**Code Quality:**
- Zero compiler warnings achieved (excellent baseline)
- Clean separation of concerns (GameState, EventHandler impl, main)
- Appropriate use of `_ctx` prefix for unused parameters (Rust convention)

### Action Items

**None.** Story approved as-is. Optional enhancements listed below are suggestions for future stories, not blockers.

**Optional Future Enhancements (Low Priority):**
1. Consider committing Cargo.lock for reproducible builds (game project best practice)
2. Add inline comment explaining dev profile `opt-level = 1` choice for learning context
