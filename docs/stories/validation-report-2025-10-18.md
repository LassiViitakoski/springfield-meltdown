## Section Results

### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

**✓ PASS** - Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
Evidence: Lines 13-15 contain all three user story fields: asA="a developer", iWant="a working ggez project with window rendering", soThat="I have a foundation to build the game on"

**✓ PASS** - Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
Evidence: Lines 29-35 contain 5 acceptance criteria (AC-1 through AC-5) that match the original story file (SPRING-001-1.1-project-setup.md lines 24-28): Cargo project with ggez, 800x600 window with black background, window title, 60 FPS, EventHandler implemented

**✓ PASS** - Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
Evidence: Lines 16-26 contain complete task list matching the story's Implementation Checklist: Create Cargo project, Add ggez dependency, Implement GameState struct, Implement EventHandler trait, Configure window settings, Verify 60 FPS, Initialize git repository, Add .gitignore, Commit initial setup

**✓ PASS** - Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
Evidence: Lines 38-69 contain 5 doc entries with proper structure (path, title, section, snippet): tech-spec-epic-SPRING-001.md (3 sections), combat-spec.md (1 section), game-design-document.md (1 section). All are relevant to project setup story.

**✓ PASS** - Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
Evidence: Lines 70-72 appropriately note "No existing code - greenfield project setup" which is accurate for this initial story. No code artifacts expected.

**✓ PASS** - Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
Evidence: Lines 91-104 define two interfaces: EventHandler trait implementation and GameState struct, both with kind, signature, and path fields. Appropriate for this setup story.

**✓ PASS** - Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
Evidence: Lines 80-89 contain 8 constraints extracted from tech spec and dev notes: ggez version, git setup, main.rs structure, Cargo.toml dependencies, Rust ownership, performance targets, optimization philosophy

**✓ PASS** - Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
Evidence: Lines 73-77 correctly identify Rust/Cargo ecosystem with ggez 0.9 dependency and its purpose (game framework for rendering, input, windowing)

**✓ PASS** - Testing standards and locations populated
Evidence: Lines 105-115 contain testing standards (manual playtesting, Phase 1 approach), locations (N/A for prototype with future note), and 5 test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria (AC-1 through AC-5)

**✓ PASS** - XML structure follows story-context template format
Evidence: Complete document (lines 1-117) follows template structure: metadata (lines 2-10), story (lines 12-27), acceptanceCriteria (lines 29-35), artifacts with docs/code/dependencies (lines 37-78), constraints (lines 80-89), interfaces (lines 91-104), tests (lines 105-115)

## Failed Items
None

## Partial Items
None

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
None - all checklist items passed

### Should Improve
None - context file is comprehensive and well-structured

### Consider
1. As implementation progresses beyond this initial story, ensure code artifacts section is populated with actual file references (currently correctly empty for greenfield setup)
2. When testing framework is introduced in future phases, update test locations accordingly
