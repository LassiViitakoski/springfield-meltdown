## User Story

```
AS A player
I WANT to see my character on screen
SO THAT I know where I am in the game world
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Player struct created with position (x, y)
- [x] Player renders as colored circle (placeholder sprite)
- [x] Player spawns at center of screen (400, 300)
- [x] World-to-screen coordinate transform implemented
- [x] Player sprite drawn at correct isometric position

---

## Technical Notes

- Use ggez::graphics::Mesh::new_circle() for placeholder
- Implement world_to_screen() helper function
- Player color: yellow (#FFD700)
- Radius: 16 pixels

- [x] Create circle mesh for player sprite
- [x] Render player in draw() method
- [x] Verify player appears at correct position

---

## Definition of Done

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference
- [story-context-SPRING-001.SPRING-001-1.2.xml](story-context-SPRING-001.SPRING-001-1.2.xml) - Generated 2025-10-18

### Debug Log
- Implemented Player struct with all fields per tech spec (pos, velocity, speed, hp, max_hp, radius, last_shot_time)
- Created world_to_screen() coordinate transform using isometric projection formulas
- Initial bug: Player spawned at (400, 300) world coords resulted in off-screen rendering due to isometric transform
- Fix: Changed player spawn to world origin (0, 0), camera offset positions at screen center
- Yellow circle (#FFD700) renders correctly at screen center using ggez Mesh::new_circle()

### Completion Notes
Story SPRING-001-1.2 implemented successfully. Player entity now renders as yellow circle at screen center with proper isometric coordinate transformation. All acceptance criteria verified through manual playtesting.

### File List
- src/main.rs (modified) - Added Player struct, world_to_screen(), player rendering in draw()

### Change Log
- 2025-10-18: Implemented Player entity with sprite rendering and isometric coordinate system
- 2025-10-18: Senior Developer Review notes appended - Outcome: Approve

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Lassi Viitakoski
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story SPRING-001-1.2 successfully implements player entity rendering with isometric coordinate transformation. The implementation is clean, follows Rust best practices, and meets all acceptance criteria. Code quality is high for a Phase 1 prototype with appropriate use of ggez APIs and solid architectural foundations.

### Key Findings

**None** - No blocking, high, or medium severity issues found.

**Low Severity Observations:**
1. **[Low]** Mesh creation in hot path (draw() method) - Creating new `Mesh::new_circle()` every frame is acceptable for prototype but will need optimization in future stories when multiple entities render
2. **[Low]** Hardcoded camera offset - `Vector2 { x: 400.0, y: 300.0 }` duplicated in draw(); consider extracting to GameState field in Story 1.4

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

All 5 acceptance criteria fully met:

- **AC-1 (Player struct created):** ✅ Complete - Player struct with Vector2 pos field at src/main.rs:13-21
- **AC-2 (Renders as circle):** ✅ Complete - Yellow circle (#FFD700) rendered via Mesh::new_circle() with 16px radius at src/main.rs:75-83
- **AC-3 (Spawns at center):** ✅ Complete - Player spawns at world origin (0,0), camera offset positions at screen center (400, 300) at src/main.rs:54, 71
- **AC-4 (Coordinate transform):** ✅ Complete - world_to_screen() implemented per tech spec formulas at src/main.rs:38-45
- **AC-5 (Isometric position):** ✅ Complete - Isometric projection correctly applied using TILE_WIDTH_HALF/TILE_HEIGHT_HALF constants

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Coverage:**
- Manual playtesting confirms visual rendering (player visible, yellow color, correct size)
- Coordinate transform validated through correct screen positioning
- No automated tests (per Phase 1 strategy - manual testing only)

**Gaps:**
- No unit tests for world_to_screen() edge cases (deferred to Phase 2 per tech spec)
- No validation of coordinate transform accuracy beyond visual inspection (acceptable for prototype)

### Architectural Alignment

**Strengths:**
- Follows ggez EventHandler pattern correctly (update/draw separation)
- Data structures align with tech spec (Player struct fields match spec exactly)
- Coordinate system implementation matches spec formulas precisely
- Rust ownership handled correctly (Player stored directly in GameState, no unnecessary heap allocations)

**Alignment with Tech Spec:**
- ✅ Module structure: Using main.rs as specified for Story 1.2 (modularization in future stories)
- ✅ Data models: Player struct matches tech spec signature (pos, velocity, speed, hp, max_hp, radius, last_shot_time)
- ✅ Coordinate system: Isometric projection formulas correct per combat-spec.md
- ✅ Performance: No heap allocations in hot path, simple structures prioritized

### Security Notes

No security concerns for this story. Single-player offline game with no external inputs, file I/O, or unsafe code.

### Best-Practices and References

**Rust Best Practices:**
- ✅ Proper use of Result<T, E> with GameResult throughout
- ✅ Appropriate use of #[allow(dead_code)] annotation for forward-declared fields
- ✅ Const for magic numbers (TILE_WIDTH_HALF, TILE_HEIGHT_HALF)
- ✅ Clear, descriptive variable names and inline comments

**ggez 0.9 Best Practices:**
- ✅ Correct Canvas API usage (from_frame, draw, finish)
- ✅ Proper DrawParam usage for positioning
- ✅ Mesh creation follows ggez 0.9 patterns

### Action Items

**None** - Implementation approved as-is for Story 1.2 scope.

**Future Optimization Opportunities (Not Blocking):**
1. Cache mesh creation when implementing multiple entities (Story 1.3+)
2. Extract camera_offset to GameState field (Story 1.4 Camera & Debug UI)
3. Consider unit tests for world_to_screen() in Phase 2
